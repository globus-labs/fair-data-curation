# Fundamentals of FAIR Data

> This repository is part of the [FAIR Data Use Tutorial](https://www.tms.org/FAIRDataUse2023) ran by TMS.

The fundamentals of re-usable data in science and engineering are knowing how to describe, store, and access data. 
This module covers the basics of different data formats, the tools available for storing them, and how to access data held by others.

## Installation

All of the requirements needed by this tutorial are described in an Anaconda environment file, `environment.yml`.

Build the environment by first installing Anaconda then calling: `conda env create --file enviornment.yml`.
